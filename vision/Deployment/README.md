# Deploying the Best Object Detection Model

This repository provides instructions for deploying the best object detection model (YOLOv5, Faster R-CNN, SSD) after training on custom datasets for tasks such as plant and disease detection. The deployment process includes exporting the trained model, setting up the deployment environment, and serving the model via a web or API-based interface.
